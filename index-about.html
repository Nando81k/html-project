            About Me
        </h2>

        <p class="aboutMe">
            New Yorker through and through. Born in Hamilton Heights into a Dominican household I was taught the importance of hardwork. This city has moulded me into the person I am today.
            Everyday is an opportnuty to grow and become better in every way. I enjoy setting goals but I enjoy working towards the goal more than the goal itself.
            Its the New York state of mind, its not a mindset, its a grind-set. 
            Born August 1st, 2000 at the Presbyterian Hospital on Amsterdam in the Upper West Side is where my story begins.
            Growing up I only had my mother and my grand-mother. My father was, unfortunatly, deported before I was even born.
            Even with this set-back, my mother somehow managed to graduate from college and provide me everything I ever wanted and needed.
            I learned how to speak English and Spanish simultaneously because my grand-mother was an immigrant and came to the U.S in the late 70's and could only speak spanish.
            I then began to go to elementary school. Im also an avid Street Fighter player. I was ranked top 100 in the world so make sure to check out some of my clips!!!
